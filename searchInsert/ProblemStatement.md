# Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.   

#### You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.  

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5   
Output: 2   

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2   
Output: 1

### Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7   
Output: 4

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var searchInsert = function(nums, target) {
    
};
```
